```lrc
[00:00.73] My voice will rise
[00:04.43] My fate is planned
[00:07.94] No crown was given
[00:11.37] I made it mine
[00:14.35] Let storms descend
[00:18.19] Let thunder strike land
[00:21.78] I march where heaven draws the line
[00:39.28] 
[00:45.23] Lift your eyes
[00:48.36] Restore the fall
[00:52.80] Grace will cleanse them all
[01:06.30] 
[01:03.37] Here I stand
[01:09.48] The sacred path is bathed in grace
[01:18.51] Not by will
[01:23.47] But true romance
[01:31.47] 
[01:29.70] Bled through oaths sworn before
[01:33.15] Kept what none but I could hold
[01:36.84] I stood to guide them back to soul
[01:53.84] 
[01:43.45] Spoke the truth through ash and flame
[01:46.97] Now I rise beyond the name
[01:50.37] Come still pray with me
[02:01.87] 
[01:57.24] My voice will rise
[02:00.97] My fate is planned
[02:04.47] No crown was given
[02:07.98] I made it mine
[02:10.83] Let storms descend
[02:14.63] Let thunder strike land
[02:18.28] I march where heaven draws the line
[02:35.78] 
[02:38.36] Lift your eyes
[02:41.22] Restore the fall
[02:46.27] Grace will cleanse them all
